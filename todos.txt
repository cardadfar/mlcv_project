- add wandb visualizations (train loss, test loss)
- add class IDs to dataloader
- add classifier (discriminator) to training cycle
    - need to create a pretraied classifier?
- add web visualizer of latent space
    - have an additional autoencoder to get top 3 dims? 
    - or maybe we can use PCA?
